# Phase status

## Current platform state

The core execution spine is implemented and release-gated.

Completed areas:

- foundation and toolchain
- API surface
- run state contracts
- planning
- deterministic turn execution
- provider-backed LLM turn execution
- retry and deterministic fallback
- deterministic tool execution
- evidence recording
- approvals
- verification
- final output synthesis
- in-memory storage
- SQL-backed durable persistence
- Alembic schema migrations
- PostgreSQL-ready database URL support
- persisted LLM call artifacts and usage tracking
- fake provider support
- OpenAI-compatible provider support
- hybrid Go control-plane scaffold
- Go-owned run create/list/read endpoints
- private Python agent-worker scaffold
- shared worker-boundary contracts
- unit and integration tests for the implemented platform spine
- documentation and release-readiness smoke flows

## Current recommended usage

- use memory mode for fast development
- use SQL mode for durable local validation
- use fake LLM mode for repeatable smoke testing
- use the OpenAI-compatible provider for manual provider-backed validation
- use hybrid mode for early Go control-plane and Python worker development

## Project readiness

This repository is in a strong backend MVP state for:

- demos
- portfolio presentation
- client discussions
- architecture walkthroughs
- further production hardening

## Next practical upgrades

- auth and RBAC
- Go planning and turn-advancement parity with the Python reference API
- observability and tracing
- richer provider policies
- LLM-backed planning
- frontend operator console
