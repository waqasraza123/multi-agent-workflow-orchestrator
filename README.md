# Agent Runway

Agent Runway is a backend-first execution platform for auditable AI workflows. It turns a business goal into a tracked run, creates a plan, advances execution through deterministic or provider-backed agent turns, records tool calls and evidence, verifies completion, and produces a final output.

It is designed for teams that need AI workflow automation with traceability instead of one-off chat responses.

## What It Does

- Creates and tracks workflow runs from a user goal.
- Generates deterministic task plans for repeatable execution.
- Advances work through deterministic or LLM-backed turns.
- Executes registered tools and records structured tool-call artifacts.
- Stores events, turns, approvals, verifications, outputs, and LLM call records.
- Supports human approval checkpoints.
- Produces verification reports before final output synthesis.
- Exposes the workflow through a FastAPI API and a lightweight browser console.

## Product Use Cases

Agent Runway is useful for workflow automation that needs a durable audit trail:

- technical planning and delivery breakdowns
- vendor or proposal analysis
- research workflows with evidence capture
- operational checklists with approval gates
- AI-assisted decision support where each step must be inspectable

## Execution Flow

1. Create a run from a business goal.
2. Generate the run plan.
3. Advance turns until planned tasks are completed.
4. Record tool calls, evidence, events, and LLM call artifacts.
5. Request and resolve approvals when needed.
6. Verify the run.
7. Finalize the output.

## API Highlights

Key workflow endpoints:

- `POST /runs`
- `GET /runs`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/state`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/plan`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/turns/advance`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/turns`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/events`

## Hybrid Go And Python Backend

Agent Runway is moving toward a hybrid backend:

- Go control plane in `apps/api-go`
- Python agent worker in `services/agent_worker`
- shared contracts in `packages/contracts`
- local hybrid runtime in `infra/docker`

In this model, Go owns the public API, database access, orchestration, and run state transitions. Python owns LLM/provider execution and returns structured turn outcomes over a private internal HTTP API.

The Go control plane currently owns:

- `POST /runs`
- `GET /runs`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/state`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/plan`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/plans/latest`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/turns/advance`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/verify`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/verifications/latest`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/finalize`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/outputs/latest`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/approvals`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/approvals`
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/approvals/{approval_id}/decide`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/events`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/turns`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/tool-calls`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/llm-calls`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /ready`

The remaining workflow endpoints continue to use the Python FastAPI app as the reference implementation until they are ported. In `EXECUTION_BACKEND=llm` mode, Go calls the private Python worker for turn execution and then persists the resulting state, turn, tool-call, evidence, event, and LLM-call records itself. Go also owns approval checkpoints, verifies completed runs, enforces the finalization gate, writes final outputs, and records lifecycle events. If the worker is unavailable, Go falls back to deterministic execution and records the LLM failure for audit.

The Go control plane supports opt-in RBAC with bearer or `X-API-Key` tokens. `GET /health` and `GET /ready` remain public for platform probes; workflow endpoints require viewer, operator, or admin access when `AUTH_MODE` is enabled.

The Go control plane also emits structured request logs and propagates `X-Request-ID` plus `traceparent` to the Python worker so API and worker logs can be correlated for a single execution turn.

Run the Python worker locally:

```bash
make agent-worker-dev
```

Run the Go control plane locally:

```bash
make api-go-dev
```

Use deterministic turn execution by default:

```bash
EXECUTION_BACKEND=deterministic
```

Use worker-backed LLM execution:

```bash
EXECUTION_BACKEND=llm
LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=fake
LLM_MODEL_NAME=fake-model
AGENT_WORKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

Run both services with Postgres:

```bash
make hybrid-up
```

Export the current FastAPI OpenAPI contract:

```bash
make export-openapi
```

The Go toolchain is required for `make api-go-dev`. After installing Go, run this once from `apps/api-go` to resolve module checksums:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Configuration

Storage backends:

```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=memory
STORAGE_BACKEND=sql
```

Default SQL database:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./.workdir/multi_agent_platform.db
```

Run migrations before using SQL storage:

```bash
make migrate
```

For PostgreSQL, install the same app with a PostgreSQL URL:

```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=sql
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://user:password@host:5432/database
make migrate
```

Execution backends:

```bash
EXECUTION_BACKEND=deterministic
EXECUTION_BACKEND=llm
```

LLM provider settings:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=fake
LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=openai
LLM_MODEL_NAME=fake-model
LLM_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=...
```

`LLM_API_KEY` is required when `LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=openai`.

Go API auth:

```bash
AUTH_MODE=disabled
AUTH_MODE=bearer
AUTH_MODE=api_key
AUTH_VIEWER_TOKENS=<comma-separated-read-tokens>
AUTH_OPERATOR_TOKENS=<comma-separated-write-tokens>
AUTH_ADMIN_TOKENS=<comma-separated-admin-tokens>
```

Use `AUTH_MODE=bearer` or `AUTH_MODE=api_key` outside local development. Clients can authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key: <token>`.

## Deploy On Render

Use Render as a Python web service.

1. Push this repository to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. In Render, create a new **Web Service** from the repository.
3. Set the runtime to **Python 3**.
4. Set the build command:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --no-dev
```

5. Set the start command:

```bash
uv run uvicorn multi_agent_platform.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

6. Add environment variables:

```bash
PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.11
STORAGE_BACKEND=memory
EXECUTION_BACKEND=deterministic
LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=fake
LLM_MODEL_NAME=fake-model
```

7. Deploy the service.
8. After deploy, open the Render URL. The browser console loads at `/`, and the API docs load at `/docs`.

For an LLM-backed demo, change the execution variables:

```bash
EXECUTION_BACKEND=llm
LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=openai
LLM_MODEL_NAME=<your-model-name>
LLM_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Storage note: use `STORAGE_BACKEND=memory` for the fastest Render demo. Use PostgreSQL for durable Render data.

For durable Render data, create a Render PostgreSQL database and set:

```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=sql
DATABASE_URL=<your-render-postgres-url>
```

Then run migrations as a Render pre-deploy command or one-off shell command:

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Do not use the default SQLite URL for production Render data.

Run the built-in smoke flows locally:

```bash
make smoke-memory
make smoke-sql
make smoke-llm-fake
```
